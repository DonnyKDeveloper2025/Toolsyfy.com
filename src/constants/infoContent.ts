    title: 'Privacy Policy', 
    content: `# Privacy Policy
*Effective Date: October 2024*

Your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy explains how Toolsyfy ("we", "us", or "our") handles information in connection with your use of the www.toolsyfy.com website (the "Service").

# 1. No Personal Data Collection
Toolsyfy is fundamentally a privacy-respecting service. For the vast majority of our tools, we do not collect, store, log, or share any personal information or data you input. All processing for these tools happens entirely on your device within your web browser (client-side). Your data never reaches our servers.

# 2. Local Storage
To enhance your user experience, we use your browser's local storage to save your preferences. This includes:
*   Your theme choice (light/dark mode).
*   Your list of favorite tools ("My Toolkit").
*   Site settings and customizations if you are using administrative features.
This information is stored only on your computer and is not transmitted to us.

# 3. Optional User Authentication
We use Firebase Authentication to provide an optional login feature. If you choose to create an account or log in, Firebase (a Google service) will manage your authentication credentials (email/password or phone number). We do not store this information on our servers. Please refer to the Google Privacy Policy for more information on how they handle data.

# 4. Third-Party Services & Advertising
We may use third-party services like Google AdSense to display advertisements on our site, which helps us keep the tools free. These services may use cookies or other tracking technologies to serve ads based on a user's prior visits to this and other websites.
*   You can opt out of personalized advertising by visiting Google's Ads Settings.

# 5. Data Security
Because we do not store your data on our servers, the risk of your data being compromised from our end is eliminated for all client-side tools. You are responsible for the security of the data on your own device.

# 6. Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.

# 7. Contact Us
If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us at support@toolsyfy.com.`
