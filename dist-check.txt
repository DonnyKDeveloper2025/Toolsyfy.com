# dist/ Check for Leftover "@/" Aliases

This file is a placeholder for the results of checking the production build output.

## Instructions

After running `npm run build`, you can verify that no raw "@/" aliases were left in the bundled code by running the following command in your terminal from the project root:

**On Linux/macOS:**
```sh
grep -r "@/" dist/
```

**On Windows (PowerShell):**
```powershell
Get-ChildItem -Path dist/ -Recurse | Select-String -Pattern "@/"
```

## Expected Result

The command should produce **no output**. If any files are listed, it means the alias was not correctly resolved during the build process, and the fix needs to be re-evaluated.

With the current fixes, this check is expected to pass successfully.
